# Blinkit Sales Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## Objective
To analyze Blinkit sales data to understand key factors influencing sales performance and to build a predictive model based on the same dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information related to products, outlets, and sales metrics.  
It includes missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent categorical labels, making it suitable for real-world data analysis and preprocessing.

## Key Tasks Performed

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Identified and handled missing values
- Removed duplicate records
- Standardized inconsistent categorical values
- Converted columns to appropriate data types

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed sales trends across outlets and product categories
- Compared sales performance based on outlet size and location
- Generated summary statistics and group-level insights

### Feature Engineering
- Created new features to improve analytical clarity
- Prepared data for modeling by selecting relevant variables

### Predictive Modeling
- Built a machine learning model using the cleaned dataset
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Certain outlet characteristics have a strong influence on sales
- Medium-sized outlets tend to perform better on average
- Product type and outlet location play an important role in sales variation

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, from raw data cleaning to exploratory analysis and predictive modeling.  
The insights and model can help support data-driven decision-making related to inventory planning and outlet performance optimization.
